# Camara remote control - Using Convolutional Neural Networks

A remote control that's operated via a camera, using Convolutional Neural Networks.
The remote control enables channel switching, controlling video speed through hand and fingers movements and detecting eyes blinks.
Implemented in Python, OpenCV and Keras.


Main menu: Control by the number of fingers that being held up, and back to main manu with OK sign.

1) Sleep mode: Recognize whether eye is opened or closed.
2) Backwards and forwards mode: controlling video speed through hand gestures.
3) Switch channel mode: through hand gestures.
