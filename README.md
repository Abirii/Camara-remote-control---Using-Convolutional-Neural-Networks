# Camara remote control - Using Convolutional Neural Networks

A remote control that's operated via a camera, using Convolutional Neural Networks.
The remote control enables channel switching, controlling video speed, and controlling video volume through hand and fingers movements.
And detect closed eyes.
Implemented in Python and Keras.

Main menu: Control by the number of fingers that being held up, and back to main manu with OK sign.

1) Sleep mode: Recognize whether eyes are opened or closed.
2) Backwards and forwards mode: Controlling video speed through hand gestures.
3) Switch channel mode: switch channel through hand gestures.
