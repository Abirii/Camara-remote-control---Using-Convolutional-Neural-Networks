# Camara remote control - Using Convolutional Neural Networks

A remote control that's operated via a camera, using Convolutional Neural Networks.
The remote control enables channel switching and controlling video speed and volume, through hand and fingers gestures.
The program can detect whether the user is falling asleep using closed eyes detection.
Implemented in Python and Keras.

Main menu: Control by the number of fingers being held up, and back to main manu with OK sign.

1) Sleep mode: Recognize whether eyes are opened or closed.
2) Backwards and forwards mode: Controlling video speed through hand gestures.
3) Switch channel mode: Switch channel through hand gestures.
4) Volume mode: Controlled by the distance of the hand from the camera.
