# Camara remote control - Using Convolutional Neural Networks

A remote control that's operated via a camera, using Convolutional Neural Networks.
The remote control enables channel switching, controlling video speed through hand and fingers movements and detect closed eyes.
Implemented in Python, OpenCV and Keras.


Main menu: Control by the number of fingers that being held up, and back to main manu with OK sign.
